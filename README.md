# Support Vector Machine (SVM)
## Detail of Support Vector Machine can be found at following link [here](https://github.com/MossyFighting/SVM/blob/master/report.pdf)

## Some notes:
In this project, A **support vector machine from Scratch** is implemented:
  1. Using dua-form of support vector machine optimization.
  2. SVM optimization is cast as a **convex optimization**.
  3. The **cvxpy** is used to optimize and obtain the lagrange multipliers, then support vectors are found.
  4. Some kernels are used in different examples such as: **linear kernel**, **polynomial kernel**, and **radial basis kernel**.
